1.The provided file (http_https_URLs_List): This file contains a comprehensive list of URLs, totaling 1333 lines, featuring both HTTP and HTTPS versions of various websites. It includes a wide range of domains across different categories such as social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), search engines (e.g., Google, Bing), e-commerce sites (e.g., Amazon, eBay), technology companies (e.g., Microsoft, Apple), news outlets (e.g., BBC, CNN), and many more. The file is structured with each URL listed twiceâ€”once with the http:// protocol and once with the https:// protocol. This makes it a useful resource for testing, web scraping, or any project requiring a large collection of URLs.

2.The provided file(scan_results2.xlsx):
 contains a detailed security scan report for various websites. The report is structured in a tabular format with multiple columns providing insights into the security posture of each website. Below is a description of the key columns and their significance:

Columns Description:

WEBSITE:
Lists the URLs of the websites that were scanned. Both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the websites are included.

TECHNOLOGIES:
Identifies the technologies used by the websites, such as frameworks, libraries, and server types (e.g., React, Magento, Cloudflare, etc.).

MISSING_SECURITY_HEADERS:
Highlights the security headers that are missing from the website's HTTP response. Security headers like Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, and X-XSS-Protection are crucial for protecting against various web vulnerabilities.

SQL_VULNARABILITY:
Indicates whether SQL-related vulnerabilities were detected. This includes potential SQL injection points or database-related errors.

XSS_VULNARABILITY:
Reports on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, such as the presence of inline event handlers (e.g., onclick, onmouseover) or <script> tags with content inside, which could be exploited.

INSECURE_COOKIES:
Lists cookies that are insecure due to missing attributes like HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite, or Max-Age/Expires. Insecure cookies can be exploited in attacks like session hijacking.

JAVASCRIPT_VARIABLES:
Enumerates JavaScript variables found on the website. These variables could be potential targets for exploitation if not properly secured.

JAVASCRIPT_FUNCTIONS:
Lists JavaScript functions detected on the website. Similar to variables, these functions could be exploited if they contain vulnerabilities.

SSL/TLS_INFORMATION:
Provides details about the SSL/TLS configuration of the website, including the issuer, subject, protocol version, cipher name, cipher bits, and certificate validity dates. This information is crucial for assessing the strength of the website's encryption.
